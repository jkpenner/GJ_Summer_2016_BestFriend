#Best Friends Grind Together
Escape from the meat plant! The objective is to stack your friends as fast as you can to escape. The grinder is constantly working against you, so you must work as a team to build a tower to the switch. If you don't get there before the time runs out, say BYE BYE!

This was made in nine days for the Portland Indie Game Squad's Summer Slow Jam.
